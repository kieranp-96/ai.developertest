when you have cloned my repo run 

"npm install" 

this will install everything I have used, tailwind, express helmet ect

once completed run 

"npm start" 


this will start up the server make sure that it is running to see data.

for me I used live server extension on my index.html to see the work I did but feel free to do it anyway you would like 



Thanks for the opportunity Kieran <3
